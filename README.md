# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a Tic Tac Toe game created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It follows the tutorial "JavaScript Tic Tac Toe Project Tutorial - Unbeatable AI w/ Minimax Algorithm" by Beau from the FreeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

## Game Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a grid of 3x3 cells. The goal of the game is to get three of your own symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game features a player versus AI mode, where you can play against an unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. The AI opponent will always make the optimal move, making it a great challenge for players.

## How to Play

- Open the tictactoe.html file in a web browser.
- The game board will be displayed with a 3x3 grid.
- Each cell represents a spot where you can place your symbol.
- Click on an empty cell to place your symbol.
- The AI opponent will automatically take its turn after you.
- Continue taking turns until the game ends.
- The game ends when either a player wins or there is a tie.
- If you want to play again, click the "Replay" button.

## Game Implementation

### The game is implemented using the following files:

- tictactoe.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the game, including the game board, endgame message, and the replay button.
- style.css: This file contains the CSS styles that define the look and layout of the game.
- script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that powers the game logic, including player turns, win detection, AI opponent, and game restart functionality.
